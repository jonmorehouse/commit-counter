Git Commit Counter
=====================

One of the best ways to measure personal productivity (for me) is via Github Contributions (ie: commits). In my opinion, a commit should be a tangible task finished, or a quantifiable amount of work. Though they are different, it is nice to see how many contributions in a day have occurred.

This works by updating a system wide file on each commit. The timer then checks the length of the file for each day and will display the number of contributions that have occurred.

I recommend using this [git-template](http://github.com/jonmorehouse/scripts) which has a pre-commit script which will automatically update a ~/.commits directory with the corresponding daily files.
